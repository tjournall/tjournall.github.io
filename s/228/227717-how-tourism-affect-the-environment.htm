        <p>Tourism is the world‚Äôs largest industry which is gradually increasing nowadays. This topic is interesting for me, because environment of my country worries me and I like visiting different nature-rich recreation centers of Kazakhstan. The most attended countries are Maldives, Seychelles, European countries. Also Kazakhstan is one of the countries that faced to rapid growth of tourism. So, in this case the question arises: Is it true that tourism has any bad effects on environment and will ecology of our country become worse after rise of tourism?</p>

            <div class="l-island-a">
    
        <p>I am biased about the fact that tourism affects the environment. I think that large tourism can lead to bad consequences and change local climate. Pollution occurs in water as well as on the land. Also tourism leads to degradation of underwater life. Flora and fauna of marine life is shortening every month. Tourism industry is overusing water to hotels, swimming pools and other entertaining activities. Often wastewater from that stuff goes straight to seas and oceans. According to increase of tourists, amount of transport also rise and it cause pollution of atmosphere. Harmful gases lead to Global warming and Acid rains. Moreover, to build touristic accommodations, camps, recreation centers they have to cut forests, disturb animals and their habitat.</p>

            <div class="l-island-a">
    
        <p>I will compare different data to make conclusion and suggest way of solving that problems. In this research I will try to find answers to questions like: How tourists affect on appearance of environmental problems? Is it important to develop tourism if it has bad influence to the environment?</p>

The volume of natural contamination in Kazakhstan developed by 4% in 2016, Kazpravda.kz reports citing an examination conducted by Ranking.kz. "After 3 a long time of decrease, the sum of poison outflows into the air within the Republic of Kazakhstan expanded again, and in 2016 the entire volume of outflows was 2.3 million tons, 4.2% more than in 2015. This development has for all intents and purposes neutralized the endeavors of the state and commerce to diminish the level of natural contamination accomplished within the past three a long time. From 2013 to 2015, the volume of hurtful outflows into the climate diminished by 8.6%," the study notes.</p>

        <p>As summer is the most popular season for tourism and beach tourism is widespread, it becomes clear that cities with hot climate are more at risk of environmental degradation. Also large and more popular cities attract more tourists and more pollution occurs there, respondents think that large amount of people will cause air pollution as amount of traffic increases. </p>

They mentioned that largest cities of our country like Almaty, Nur-Sultan and Kokshetau are more likely to have environmental problems, because they are popular among tourists. While East Kazakhstan region seems to face with environmental problems caused by tourism less than other cities, because tourism is not very developed in our hometown. </p>

        <p>Unfortunately, in Kazakhstan ecotourism is not so popular, it is due to people do not think about their actions. Nonetheless I think that our country has all chances to develop ecotourism, because we have greatest nature and the main thing to do is to change people‚Äôs behavior. I believe that, if we will teach our children to take care of nature and explain the importance of preserving the environment, then in the future they will be able to develop ecotourism in the country.</p>

        <p>Firstly, to build all of touristic facilities a lot of forests cut down, that is large change of ecosystem, also to make all materials for construction a lot of factories are working and emitting gases into the atmosphere. Secondly, transports by which tourists travel also makes air pollution. In big cities local residents have to face with noise pollution, because of different entertainments for tourists (bars, crowded streets, night clubs, restaurants, main squares etc.). And the main problem, which occurs because of tourism, is the land pollution. Tourists often do not care about ecology; they simply do not clean after themselves after camping, throw thrash anywhere they want.</p>

        <p>Despite that tourism has a lot of bad consequences we should develop tourism.

        <p>It was concluded that the most vulnerable cities are Almaty and Nur-Sultan. These cities are the biggest ones of our country and that is why the mot attractive ones. They prone to have a lot of air, noise and land pollution, as many tourists want to see these cities (about 55 thousand people visit Almaty per year). </p>

        <p>I made 3 methods to do this research and I noticed that all respondents have approximately similar responses. I detected that all of them think that development of tourism is important for economy of country, that ecotourism is the best way to reduce amount pollution. But as the quarantine was declared I could not take interview from specialists and create a focus group discussion with different people. As I planned in methods section interview from worker of touristic organization in East Kazakhstan region, person who travels frequently and one of ecologists of our city and focus group discussion with four people that visited a lot of recreation center. Even if my plans for methods section were failed I made 2 of my methods with people that I know and I think that ideas and answer they shared were valuable and useful for me. Also while conducting focus group discussion I faced with problem that as my respondents are at home and all of them have their household routine connection t the chat was not simultaneously, but I got all needed answers.</p>

        <p>So, my hypothesis was correct, that in the future environment of Kazakhstan can suffer from tourism but we can solve it now if we will act correctly and move to ecotourism. After working on context section and gathering a lot of information my bias confirmed, tourism really can lead to bad consequences and ecology suffers from it.</p>

        <p>1. The first survey method was conducted to answer the some research questions, like How tourists affect on appearance of environmental problems? What should touristic organizations do in order to save our ecology in good conditions? Is it important to develop tourism if it has bad influence to the environment? In the survey, both multiple-choice and open-ended questions were compiled, which contributed to obtaining complete answers to the questions asked. This method helped in an anonymous way to find out the precise opinions of independent respondents as they were not biased regarding their attitude to this topic. Strong sides of my survey are that I conducted it among different aged group of people and could recognize how person‚Äôs opinion changes by years. Weak side of first method was that amount of respondents was less than wanted, I think that if number of respondents were bigger the results would be more reliable and I would get more ideas for open ended questions in survey.</p>

        <p>2. Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt say that my second and third methods covered perfectly. As we had quarantine and I could not contact to ecologist and worker of touristic organization to conduct an interview and invite them to focus group discussion. Even if my plans for methods segment were failed I made 2 of my methods with people that I know and I think that thoughts and answer they shared were profitable and useful for me. Moreover, while conducting focus group discussion I confronted with issue that my respondents are at home and all of them have their household routine, because of that the chat connection was not at the same time, but I got all required answers. I tried to make triangulation, I used information that I get from survey to construct questions for interview and after interview I went back to my research aim and questions and thought up on questions that we should discuss.</p>

        <p>3. While writing the survey results, I had to generalize the answer and output the average responses, but when I did the cross-tabulation, I looked at the responses of each Respondent and entered the answer in the table. Thus, I can say that the conclusions I made are fairly generalized. But I think that my sample interview and focus group discussion was not different aged people and their answers have to be similar. </p>

        <p>My research was about negative impact of tourism to the environment and I think that this topic is relevant today, because nowadays all people like traveling and going out to the nature. My research is helpful to recognize real consequences of tourism and how we can prevent all those ecological problems.</p>

        <p>In order to improve the existing work I think that I should to change focus group discussion to observation, in order to see how people actually behave. As results of interview and focus group discussion were roughly similar I guess that people can lie that they clean after themselves. Also in further research I should find contacts of experts and plan our meeting for interview much earlier, because expert opinion is very important for any research. There were no unexpected results and answers, my hypothesis proved and biased opinion did not change.</p>
