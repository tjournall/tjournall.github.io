The authorities of Kazakhstan are taking various measures to combat fake news. For example, the official website on COVID-19 has a whole section devoted to fakes.

        <p>Beksultan is a small and medium-sized business owner. He owns businesses such as a children's education centre, a computer club and a rhythmic gymnastics school. Small businesses have been hit very hard by the pandemic, and these include computer clubs where visitors mainly play multiplayer computer games for an hourly fee.</p>

        <p>Beksultan opened the computer club in late 2019, three months before the first lockdown. "<i>We opened at the end of December. We invested a lot of money and effort, with great hope that all the expenses would pay off.

        <p>In March 2020, Beksultan closed to quarantine and dutifully did not operate until June. At the time, this seemed the only right solution, as the coronavirus situation in Kazakhstan was just gaining its crushing momentum. Everyone was worried about their loved ones and their own health, and social media and social networks were buzzing with headlines about every new infected person. In such a kaleidoscope of events, an unexpected holiday was overshadowed and perceived more as a good opportunity to spend more time with family. The "monthly" payment of 42500 seemed ludicrous at the time, but in the absence of tax and loan payments, it could more or less cover the costs. </p>

            <div class="l-island-a">
    
        <p>In reality, however, things were not all rosy: the social benefit was not available to everyone, and in Beksultan's family no one received it. The only thing that saved them was a safety cushion specially prepared for such an event.</p>

        <p>We have mentioned "connections" for a reason, as in our corrupt country they play a significant role. We will explain why. Surely you remember how last year football club Kairat held a luxurious party on the occasion of their championship. However, at that time there were serious quarantine restrictions and a ban on major events in the country.</p>

        <p>He is like the famous character in Miguel De Cervantes' story, Don Quixote. Constantly fighting the mills, thinking that he is doing good by it, although he is glad to taste the bread of the mills himself. Almaty's sanitary doctor attended the wedding of a high-ranking official's daughter, details of the newlyweds are scarce, but according to unconfirmed information the daughter of the head of the Police was there. This was reported by one of our witnesses and an eyewitness who worked as a waiter at the restaurant where the event took place. Bekshin behaved rather shyly, clearly fearing attention, but nevertheless deigned to dance, where he was seen on camera. Not surprisingly, since the dance on the bones so succinctly describes the situation in the country.</p>

        <p>Bekshin's favoured excuse 'it's a fake' did not materialise this time. The department's press office confirmed that Mr Bekshin did indeed give permission to Capital Tower Development LLP, and, of course, not for commercial gain, but for a good cause - "on the occasion of a one-off event to celebrate the athletes and staff training. Somehow Bekshin forgot to mention in the permit the one-off nature of this "event", and the small detail - in what clause of his decree are such exceptions prescribed for mass events? If memory serves us right his regulations prohibit any mass gathering of people. But there was an answer to this too: the hotel is on full alert and the air in the hotel is more sterile than in infectious diseases hospitals. </p>

        <p>But who is this chosen one who can skirt the rules so easily? It is Kairat Boranbayev, a well-known oligarch in Kazakhstan, who owns the Ritz-Carlton.

In turn, this organization has two owners - Kairat Boranbayev and Esentai Investments LLP. Boranbayev also owns the football club Kairat. </p>

        <p>Is it possible that Kairat knew in advance about this victory? One can only speculate, since Bekshin gave his permission on September 30, and the exact date of "honouring the athletes" is not specified in the document. The department's press office explained that "the Kairat team planned to hold a meeting at the hotel" and that the exact date was not specified in the permit, since the owner of Kairat himself did not know it - the document, we were told, was given for an indefinite period, so that the company could only hold the "event" once.</p>

        <p>In reality, however, it turns out that Ritz was not entirely honest. Hiding behind a piece of paper from Bekshin, the luxury hotel quietly held equally luxurious weddings. On one of these toys, the offenders were caught. </p>

        <p>As you know, last autumn there were three fires at the Almaty flea market, and in one case the Emergency Situations Ministry discovered arson. The general public is still wondering who the "beneficiary" of these fires is. We conducted our own investigation in order to answer a question - what are the names of the true owners of the "spontaneously combusting" flea market whose days are numbered, and who owns the land on Kuldjinskij tract where the new wholesale clothing market of the Southern Capital is to be built. </p>

        <p>By a strange coincidence, the development of the plots has intensified immediately after a series of fires in Almaty's markets, located on the Northern Ring. The owner of these plots of land is Status Conctruction LLP. It was very difficult for us to get information about its founders, but nevertheless they turned out to be quite familiar faces. The first in the list of founders of this LLP is Nurzhan Bekshenov who in Forbes Kazakhstan magazine's list of "The 50 richest people in Kazakhstan" was 20th in 2012 and 25th in 2013. He has an estimated net worth of $290m and owns the Positive Investment Group.</p>

        <p>Looking at the whole situation described above, it can be compared to Gogol's novel "Dead Souls". In the artistic space of one of Gogol's most famous works, landowners and those in power are linked. Lies, bribery, and the desire for profit characterize each of the images of officials in "Dead Souls". Using the example of officials in the poem "Dead Souls", the most pressing problems of the Russian Empire of the mid-19th century were shown. In addition to serfdom, which hindered natural progress, the real problem was the vast bureaucratic apparatus, for the maintenance of which huge sums were allocated. The people in whose hands power was concentrated worked only for the sake of accumulating their own capital and improving their well-being, robbing both the treasury and ordinary people. Despite the fact that the novel was written in the 19th century, it is still relevant to this day. The officials sitting at the top, in such a difficult period for the people, in the midst of the pandemic, in the midst of restrictions for small businesses and ordinary entrepreneurs, allowed themselves and their relatives to engage in full bribery and holding large events. But they are simple servants of the people, who think of themselves as something great and powerful. I hope that many ordinary people will pay attention to the blatant behavior of officials and realize that Kazakhstan deserves better. I hope that we will see Kazakhstan again in a bright picture of the world.</p>
