        <p>In the modern world, music is most often perceived as entertainment.

        <p>Classical works are perceived quite differently. There are no words needed, you can't make music videos for this music. In them, every sound touches some deep chord of the soul, awakens what we have long and persistently hidden from the outside eye. We can entrust our thoughts, grief, and joy to classical music. It is no accident that Fr. Balzac said: "Beethoven and Mozart were often the confidants of my heart's secrets." The works of these great composers live their own lives, and you can talk to them, argue with them, or agree with them as with a living being. And many writers and poets, artists and sculptors, it was classical music that inspired the creation of outstanding works.</p>

        <p>In fact, according to the present, relaxation is brought by classical works that were created in order to touch all the strings of the human soul. In today's world, despite the increasing popularization of club tracks, classics still have a strong place. After all, the works of the classics are their call to eternity, to future generations, so that we, who are just this future generation, can correctly evaluate their thoughts and desires. That is why today a large number of people visit the opera and the Philharmonic, in order to merge with eternity, at least for a few hours.</p>

        <p>Musicologists can vie with each other to complete this list, telling about a special musical language, the most important artistic principles, schools and associations that have become "classical", defeating their less successful competitors in the course of history. Friends, go for a moment beyond the definitions invented by someone once and just observe the world around you. You will see that all the musicians of the planet Earth are the same by nature - they want to express themselves and earn their craft; but among them there are those who practice three types of activities at the same time: musical notation, maintaining the concert infrastructure of the philharmonic type, and honoring Tchaikovsky and Bach. I suggest calling these respected people and their values classical music, rather than archives and beautiful stories.It is necessary to understand that the classical musical tradition dominated not by chance, but because it turned out to be consistent from a scientific, philosophical and economic point of view. She easily explained any musical manifestations of a person, adapted it and continues to do so for many of our contemporaries, but does not perform this function for me personally.</p>

        <p>Notes are a type of end product in the classical tradition. When we say the word "work", we mean notes - and vice versa. A musical notation is created by a composer, it has its own end user - a musician-performer.</p>

            <div class="l-island-a">
    
        <p>Concert performance of works is the second type of "classical" final product, where the consumer is the listener. We can say that both the performer and the listener become co-authors of the composer during the concert, because the performer gives personality to the author's idea due to his sound wave, and the listener's reaction affects what is happening, gives it additional meaning, not to mention the fact that the listener invests money in production by buying a ticket. Economists will understand me well in this matter, and musicologists will say that although concert performance is a relatively independent form of artistic and creative activity, but the performer does not create a new work, his destiny is interpretation, interpretation. Let us listen to both, and use the word "work" only in relation to the musical notation, and "product" - in a broader sense.</p>

            <div class="l-island-a">
    
        <p>So, these two types of products, musical notation (musical composition) and concert performance, make up the production structure of classical music. If you write sheet music for others or perform works yourself, you are a follower of the classical tradition of music production. It doesn't matter if you're a member of Radiohead or the London Symphony Orchestra, because what you do is convert notes into sound, following the instructions of the author.</p>

            <div class="l-island-a">
    
        <p>For modern music, notes and performance are no longer enough, here both the final product and the artistic work becomes an audio recording or even a multimedia product, for example, a music video clip. Audio recordings are no longer created for performance, but for listening and playback (the phenomenon of DJ "performance" will be discussed in Chapter 2, section "Professional environment").</p>

        <p>Agree, it is difficult to argue with the fact that music is primarily what we hear? Classical music allows for a situation where the author of the work is a deaf composer, but the process of creating an audio recording is impossible to imagine without the act of listening; deaf authors in this area can not be found, which is why the logic of modern music seems to me much more convincing. You can't imagine a deaf Norman Cook creating a piece of music from samples as part of the Fatboyslim project. Drawing historical parallels, let us recall the deaf Beethoven, who successfully continued his compositional activity in his time. I dare say that he would hardly be able to claim an important role in the creation of modern music, since he could not become a music producer. His work could be of some use to other producers, but nothing more.</p>

        <p>The role of the classical composer in the studio process is no more important than the function of the screenwriter in film production. By the way, performing musicians can be compared to film actors, so we will conclude the analogy, which clearly shows that both the composer and the performer in modern music production are subordinate functions, even if they may in some cases become key. The main thing in this question is to understand and accept that without performers and composers, the creation of musical audio recordings is fundamentally possible, as well as the creation of films without screenwriters (documentaries) and actors (animated films).</p>

        <p>Some audio recordings can be recorded with notes, but in order to write a full-fledged instruction for creating a work, you will have to sign the nature of the sound timbres, frequency characteristics and types of compression; come up with designations for special effects and different sound plans, and even such a recording without attached audio files (at least the original "raw" ones) is unlikely to have the necessary meaning, the necessary value.</p>

        <p>Let's not forget about the works performed at concerts. You will say that they can also be recorded and then listened to as audio recordings. Indeed, we may come across an audio recording that will be called "Beethoven performed by such and such an orchestra", but for me the main difference between concert recordings is that they do not sound the best from sound reproducing devices. These records are something like an advertisement, a cultural and educational act, or a visual aid in the classical tradition. They can also play a supporting role to preserve the musical heritage (in case the musical notation is lost), but they themselves, in isolation from the musical material, are unlikely to be considered as new works of musical art. Concert recordings require not only listening, but also certain assumptions. About a " live "recording, we always know that it is "live", in fact, we immerse ourselves in the atmosphere and first of all imagine the event itself, evaluate the behavior of people who find themselves in the situation of a concert, but not the music and sound wave. The musicians are well aware of this, and try to record in the studio at every opportunity.</p>

            <div class="l-island-a">
    
        <p>You can successfully argue with this idea, but as a small experiment - try to remember at least one world-famous music audio track recorded at a concert. My subscribers and I tried to do this, but we only offered Zemfira with " London Sky "and Opus with"Life is Life". It's a stretch to recall compositions that mimic the atmosphere of a live concert - in which you can hear shouts from the crowd, a discordant chorus of fans - but when checked, it turns out that they were all created in the studio.</p>

            <div class="l-island-a">
    
        <p>Special attention should be paid to the works of composers who still get to the studios. In my opinion, these audio recordings are new works, works of modern music. Whether classical works (sheet music) are used in their creation, and what role they play, whether the composers ' copyrights will come into force - all this is not obvious and requires additional analysis. Depending on the timbres used, the editing techniques used, and the special effects applied, the musical material may be well guessed, or it may be distorted: so much so that if you try to "hear" the resulting audio recording with notes, you will get something completely different from the original musical text used. Just like in a movie, there may be nothing left of the original script in the end.</p>

        <p>Many musicians are happy to spend their entire lives on tours, using their performing skills in orchestras, theater, show business; but the bias towards such routine work as performing music live, in my opinion, leads rather to degradation, simplification of modern musical creativity. Perhaps the classical composers were not prevented from making music every day in churches and at balls, but modern production processes are much more complex than musical notation. As an example, I will cite the "Beatles", who in the mid-60s abandoned tour activity, as a result of which their most famous and popular works appeared. And what would happen if many other music producers found the courage to reduce the number of performances (the economics of the question aside for now), and devoted the free time to creative growth?</p>

        <p>The combination of classical and modern production traditions, of course, is possible, in addition-they mutually influence each other. Performing your music at concerts is an inspiring experience for aspiring musicians and a way to gather like-minded people for further work in the studio, and attending concerts is still an important form of cultural enrichment for a listener of any age; but ask yourself, which piece of music has made the greatest impact on your spiritual growth and life in general, heard at a concert or recorded in the studio? What should be more interesting for a creative person to leave behind-instructions for creating works, or the works themselves? For me, the answer is obvious, and someone still forces children to study the piano all day long and write musical dictation instead of spending at least half of this time analyzing the masterpieces of musical audio recordings and mastering the technologies of music production.</p>

        <p>Consciously or not, we always try to identify the sources and primary sources (authors, owners) when we listen to music. This happens both at concerts and while listening to music recordings.

So we draw a line between our own world, where we are free to do what we want, and the world of other people, where we should be more careful.<br />The "friend-friend" system allows you to represent music in seven states (see the seven sectors in the diagram). Let's try to use this theory to explain the weaknesses of modern music as an art compared to classical music.

    </div>

        
        
            
            
        
            
        
        
        
            <div class="l-island-a">
    
        <p>And now let's move on to the most important question - what is <b>the art of music?</b> How can the music of your soul simultaneously be alien and harmoniously complement the world around you?</p>
    </div>

        
        
            
            
        
            
        
        
        
            <div class="l-island-a">
    
        <p>A concert or performance is a situation in which music has every chance to become something more for the listener, because the degree of mutual influence of one's own and another's is determined in advance. We are told who is the author of the works, we respect them as strangers, but at the same time we have the opportunity to touch this culture, understand it, make it our own. This is how classical music becomes art.</p>
    </div>

        
        
            
            
        
            
        
        
        
            <div class="l-island-a">
    
        <p>Modern music has one big difference. Our "communication" with a device that plays audio recordings does not lend itself to the same unambiguous assessment as playing a musical instrument or attending a concert.</p>
    </div>

        
        
            
            
        
            
        
        
        
            <div class="l-island-a">
    
        <p>Yes, what we hear from the speakers or headphones comes from the outside world. At the same time, it is also something of our own, because we found the file on the network or on our device, we control the sound wave in time by pressing the "play" and "stop" buttons; and DJs can change the sound at all through mixing and special effects.</p>
    </div>

        
        
            
            
        
            
        
        
        
            <div class="l-island-a">
    
        <p>In order to consider a musical recording as a work of art, it must remain "alien" to us and others, we must have due respect for the authors, feel certain boundaries, but do we want this?</p>
    </div>

        
        
            
            
        
            
        
        
        
            <div class="l-island-a">
    
        <p>Remember how often you can't tell who the creator of a track is. Sometimes we know what radio is playing or what DJ is "playing", what is the name of the singer or singer, but almost 100% of the time we do not want to know who exactly is the music producer of the record. In contrast, by the way, to the classical tradition with its indispensable mention of composers; or cinema, where the role of the director is always and everywhere emphasized.</p>
    </div>

        
        
            
            
        
            
        
        
        
            <div class="l-island-a">
    
        <p>When we take an audio file and insert it into our playlist, we cut off the connection with the author, making his music a part of our daily life; and our respect for someone else's work is carried away somewhere on the periphery of consciousness. Many of us love the sound recordings of our playlist or DJ mix too much to "share" them with the creators. As a result, we ourselves become "authors-performers" who give music to the world by pressing the "play" button, mixing tracks. In this way, modern music becomes a musical culture, but loses the signs of musical art.</p>

        <p>The fact of the existence of many musical cultures (subcultures) will not be disputed by any art critic. Individual contemporary works, forms and genres have their own fans, but how do we relate to this diversity? How can we distinguish what we will call art after all?</p>

        <p>In classical music, two mechanisms were developed that are still successfully used today.</p>
    </div>

        
        
            
            
        
            
        
        
        
            <div class="l-island-a">
    
        <p>The first criterion of a work of art is the presence of musical education among its creators - composers and performers. In the process of education, pupils and students are encouraged to respect the creativity of others and are taught to "master" it.</p>
    </div>

        
        
            
            
        
            
        
        
        
            <div class="l-island-a">
    
        <p>We have already talked enough about the problems of the academic tradition, and we will talk further, so we understand that this filter is still poorly applicable to modern music. Many, if not most, of the creators of the tracks we value are musical "non-learners" or "under-learners" simply because they didn't have to study to be performers, composers, conductors, or sound engineers. They acted on a whim, gathering talented people around them, creating their own standards of music production. Modern music is a combination of these accidents, the legacy of the geniuses of music production.</p>

            <div class="l-island-a">
    
        <p>The second criterion that can be used in the classical tradition is expert opinions. The competence of musicologists includes reviews, scientific and journalistic publications, research, participation in the jury of ratings and awards. The results of this activity form the agenda for patrons and sponsors, state and non-profit organizations engaged in the preservation of cultural heritage.</p>

        <p>Since 1958, musicians have received the Grammy Award, established by the Recording Industry Association of America. Among the nominations there are not only "Album of the Year" or "Record (single) of the Year", but also video clips, soundtracks, arrangement, and even a prize for the best cover. Notably, the award is given for " artistic achievement, technical excellence, and significant contribution to the development of sound recording without taking into account sales and chart positions." In some of the main categories, the award is given to both authors and producers with engineers.</p>

            <div class="l-island-a">
    
        <p>In addition, not only in the United States, but also around the world in the second half of the XX century, music journalism and criticism developed quite actively. The sharks of the pen tried to analyze the upcoming albums, interviewed their creators, and created charts. The development of radio broadcasting in the FM band and the emergence of music TV channels were a major help.</p>
    </div>

        
        
            
            
        
            
        
        
        
            <div class="l-island-a">
    
        <p>Thanks to the achievements of the recording and broadcasting industries, by the ' 90s we had almost no doubt about the independent important role of many producers like Phil Spector or Brian Eno, because we saw an independent assessment of their work. At that time, it seemed that there was very little time left to wait until the approval of modern music as an independent part of the art sphere, music journalism and criticism could fulfill this mission, but the digital revolution came inopportunely. Magazines were closed one by one, and radio stations began to focus exclusively on ratings, leaving less and less space for constructive criticism and author programs.</p>

            <div class="l-island-a">
    
        <p>It was extremely difficult for individual enthusiasts to fight these trends, because thanks to the availability of music creation technologies, the volume of audio recordings produced has grown significantly over two decades. Now dozens of critics, with all their desire, can not listen to millions of tracks and analyze them qualitatively. The Grammy Awards, of course, still have some weight, but it is hardly enough for a multipolar world.</p>

        <p>The formation of a stable system of independent and unbiased evaluation by professional listeners (producers, critics, musicologists) can help to recognize contemporary music as one of the art directions.</p>

        <p>Fortunately, for 2018, the situation no longer looks so hopeless. Special service technologies are being developed to adequately analyze huge volumes of music. For example, the algorithms of the Yandex.Music project help its editors to conduct research on the musical influence of Kazakh regions or the lexical development of Kazakh rap. The chatbot helps the Music Lovers of KZ community automate listening and voting in the framework of the Vkontakte Music service, during which hundreds of people compare up to four hundred songs and video clips a year, and as a result, ratings of unknown hits of KZ are published and awards are organized.</p>
